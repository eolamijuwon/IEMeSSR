# **Requirements**

As you may have already known, R is a **powerful**, cross-platform, open-source, and **free** software that has been widely adopted across a number of [social]science fields. The session will focus on laying a groundwork to enable future self-teaching of specific use cases *[models, packages, analysis]*. A number of platforms provide *free* training resources for learning R online. This includes but not limited to [*edX*](https://www.edx.org/), [*Cousera*](https://www.coursera.org/), [*Udacity*](https://www.udacity.com/), and of course [*YouTube*](https://www.youtube.com/),

For the session, you will be required to have R and Rstudio installed on your computer. If you are still to download/install R, please [[click here](https://cloud.r-project.org/)] or [[here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)] to download RStudio
