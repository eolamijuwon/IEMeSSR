# This program predicts the weight of a fish using the length, height and width 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Load Data

```{r}
# 1. READ IN THE DATA
df <- read.csv('Fish.csv')
head(df)
```
## DATA ANALYSIS

```{r}
# check for missing values
any(is.na(df))
```
Graph of Weight vs Height plot
``` {r}
library(ggplot2)
# Weight vs Height plot
#ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Weight, y=Height)) + geom_point()
plot(Weight~Height, data=df)
```

```{r}
library(corrgram)
# correlation check
corrgram(df, lower.panel=panel.shade, upper.panel=panel.cor)
```

Divide the dateset into two, 70% Training Set and 30% test set
```{r}
library(caTools)
# 3. TRAIN/TEST SPLIT
set.seed(42)

sampleSplit <- sample.split(Y=df$Weight, SplitRatio=0.7)
trainSet <- subset(x=df, sampleSplit==TRUE)
testSet <- subset(x=df, sampleSplit==FALSE)
```
Train the model using trainSet data

```{r}
# 4. TRAIN THE MODEL
model <- lm(formula=Weight ~ ., data=trainSet)
summary(model)
```
# Visualise the Residual

The difference between the observed value of the dependent variable (y) and the predicted value (ŷ) is called the residual (e). Each data point has one residual.

Residual = Observed value - Predicted value

Both the sum and the mean of the residuals are equal to zero

A residual plot is a graph that shows the residuals on the vertical axis and the independent variable on the horizontal axis. If the points in a residual plot are randomly dispersed around the horizontal axis, a linear regression model is appropriate for the data; otherwise, a nonlinear model is more appropriate.

```{r}
# visualize residuals
modelResiduals <- as.data.frame(residuals(model))
ggplot(modelResiduals, aes(residuals(model))) + 
  geom_histogram(fill='deepskyblue', color='black')
```

# Make Prediction
```{r}
# 5. MAKE PREDICTIONS
preds <- predict(model, testSet)
preds
```

# Evaluate the prediction model
Calculate the mean squared error (MSE). The MSE of an estimator (of a procedure for estimating an unobserved quantity) measures the average of the squares of the errors — that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and what is estimated


Calculate the Root mean square error (RMSE) or root mean square deviation.  RMSE is one of the most commonly used measures for evaluating the quality of predictions. It shows how far predictions fall from measured true values using Euclidean distance.
```{r}
# 6. EVALUATE PREDICTIONS
modelEval <- cbind(testSet$Weight, preds)
colnames(modelEval) <- c('Actual', 'Predicted')
modelEval <- as.data.frame(modelEval)
head(modelEval)

mse <- mean((modelEval$Actual - modelEval$Predicted)^2)
mse

rmse <- sqrt(mse)
