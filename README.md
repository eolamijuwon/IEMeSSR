# Introduction

There is an increasing amount of data on every aspect of human activities, thus creating an unprecedented potential to address longstanding social science research questions. However, data analysis from these and several other sources requires both scalable computational tools and an understanding of how the substantive scientific questions should drive the data analysis. This introductory workshop on emerging methodologies in social science research will provide social scientists with the opportunity to develop the tools necessary to uncover new and relevant insights. 


The workshop will be divided into three different sections covering five days of tutorials and activities. In the first days, we explore an introduction to coding in social sciences with a special focus on data wrangling and analysis using R. In the second category, we retrieve data from digital footprints, especially those generated by existing platforms like Twitter, Facebook, GoogleTrends and others. In the last category, we explore reproducible analysis using R Studio. Subsequently, the workshop will cover the use of R for basic demographic methods and a demo on the emerging field of computation and digital demography. As you may have already known, R is a **powerful**, cross-platform, open-source, and **free** software that has been widely adopted across a number of [social]science fields. The session will focus on laying a groundwork to enable future self-teaching of specific use cases *[models, packages, analysis]*. A number of platforms provide *free* training resources for learning R online. This includes but not limited to *[edX](https://www.edx.org/)*, *[Cousera](https://www.coursera.org/)*, *[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)*, and of course *[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)*, 


For the session, you will be required to have R and Rstudio installed on your computer. If you are still to download/install R, please [[click here](https://cloud.r-project.org/)] or [[here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)] to download RStudio
